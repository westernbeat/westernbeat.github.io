          <h1>Project Idea</h1>
          <h4>Panic Mitigation and Supply Control</h4>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">This Application is designed to help people to manage supplies in their home. It will
            create a shopping
            lists automatically based on what has been used and what is still available. It will also give notifications
            regarding expiry dates on food</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The motivation for this application idea has manifested due to the current economic and
            humanitarian crisis
            we are all facing due to the to the covid-19 pandemic. It saddens me that there is so much panic and
            distress amongst not only our communities in Australia, but around the world. Everyone has been affected by
            the shortage in supplies.

            This is having a major impact on our communities most vulnerable. I am not only referring to our global
            senior community. I am talking about everyone. Disabled, unemployed, student’s, parent’s and thier children.
            In a time of crisis, it may not matter how much money we have because, if we can’t buy food and supplies, we
            will feel the impact of any crisis on a much deeper level.

            This has raised the question. Can something be done? </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The Community supply control is an Idea I have to mitigate the impact of panic buying
            during times of crisis and hopefully prevent it. The main aim is to monitor supply to individuals for
            critical items such as groceries. It is also designed to limit the crowds which attend supermarkets by
            implementing odd and even days similar to that of water restrictions. This will be determined by street
            number.

            In order to enter the supermarket, the customer must first scan your card at a card reader which will open
            the doors. The card must then be scanned at the checkout and will alert the checkout attendant if an item
            has been over purchased. The customer can monitor their limits on a mobile application and if they scan the
            item with their phone it will let them know if they can purchase it which will save embarrassment at the
            checkout.

            The customer can purchase the maximum per person allowance for each member of their family without the other
            members attending the store.

            This system with be linked with the relevant departments such as the department of human services and will
            allow the implemented limits to be across the country rather than each supermarket.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            This system will require the use of cards. A Medicare card can be used as an alternative to dispensing new
            cards. Card readers will be required, and databases will need to be created and managed. It will be
            dependent on mobile applications and API’s.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Skills required</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">In order to successfully develop this system, the team of developers will need to be able
            to program using
            languages such as JAVA, Python, C#, C++ and swift to develop the applications to interact with the system
            such mobile, desktop and web applications.

            Programming knowledge of SQL will be required to develop the Database management systems to store customer
            information, previous purchases and limits which have been enforced. PHP will be used for communicating
            between the application and the database. It will be important to have the appropriate knowledge to be able
            use Application programming interfaces (API’s) as these may be important in the development of the system to
            allow our supermarkets and the department of human services to work together. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The successful integration of this application in the community will vastly mitigate the
            distress felt by
            all members affected by an emergency where panic buying has or is at risk of occurring. This will be due to
            the ability that supermarkets will have to monitor customer limits on purchases such as one per person.
        </div>
        This will further mitigate the issue a lot of people who work are facing, such as not being able to go to the
        store until the end of the day when shelves have been cleared, or families only being able to get only one of an
        item such as pasta when there are more than one person in the home because a partner is at work and the kids are
        at school and cannot attend the grocery store.

        This will solve the problem families are facing by drastically reducing the crowds within a supermarket by
        having odd and even days. It will allow one person in a home to buy enough supplies within the limits allowed
        for each person in that family without everyone being there. This will encourage society to function as normal
        as possible during a time of mass panic and uncertainty.

        The development of this system will have a positive impact on the community. Although it will be frustrating, if
        successful It should aid the reduction of violence and aggression, encourage compassion, honesty and integrity.
        But most of all it will bring the community together, not divide it. And everyone will get their fair share.

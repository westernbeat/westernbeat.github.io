              <h3>A little about myself</h3>
              <p>My name is James. Although, I prefer to be addressed as Jim. I was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1983
                and
                raised in Sydney until the age of 15. My only spoken language is English however, I can communicate with
                people from the deaf community using some basic AUSLAN (Australian sign language). This is due to the kindness of
                Latrobe university who funded a private tutor to come to my home weekly for 20 weeks to say thanks for allowing my
                profoundly deaf daughter to participate in a study into the development of children with Cochlear
                Implants. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                In 1999 I left school mid-way through year 10 to begin an apprenticeship. I am now a qualified
                plasterer
                after completing my Certificate III General Construction (Wall and Ceiling lining) in 2003. I attended
                Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE(NMIT) Now known as Melbourne Polytechnic. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Immediately after completing my apprenticeship, I joined the Australian Army as a Gun Number (Gunner).
                A Gunner is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Artillery Gun. In case you’re wondering,
                the primary objective of the Artillery is to support the infantry with indirect firepower. A Gunner is
                also referred to as a ‘nine-mile sniper’ can hit a 40-gallon drum from up to 15km away from the target.

                <h3>When did my interest in IT start</h3>
                My interest in IT began as a young child with my commodore 64. I have never been afraid to try things
                and
                always felt comfortable interacting with technology. I have broken many computers in the process and
                always
                investigated and hopefully repaired the problem.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
              <p>
                Programming is my passion. In 2018 and with no programming experience, I began Investigating the
                possibility
                that I could develop an application myself because I could never seem to find one that met my needs.
                Although
                there are so many great applications on the market, I found myself using many of which only met a
                specific purpose.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                I spent the first 3 months completely frustrated that I couldn’t seem to understand programming. There
                were times I began to
                believe I wasn’t intelligent enough and I almost quit. Rather than toss the idea into the too hard
                basket, I continued to persist and
                eventually things began to make sense.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>What sparked my interest</h3>
              <p>
                In September 2018 I fractured my spine and had to rethink my career prospects. I was completely
                immobile. I became depressed, anxious and
                overwhelmed by my situation. My amazing ex-wife assisted me to explore options to keep my mind occupied
                and suggested I focus on programming
                while in recovery. Ultimately, I fell in love with programming which triggered an intense desire pursue
                a career in software development.

            <div>
              <h3>IT Experience</h3>
              <p>
                I have never been employed in an IT field. The extent of my experience stems no further than as an end
                user. I have experience using Invoicing
                applications, Microsoft office products. I have spent countless hours learning not only how to Program
                using different languages, but also the fundamentals of programming in general.
                I have completed SIT102 Introduction to Programming with Deakin College, and finished with a HD 95%. At
                the time I completed this unit the final result was determined by a learning portfolio only.
              </p>

                Programming</a></h5>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Why I chose to study at RMIT</h3>
              <p>
                Firstly, Due to my early life choices such as pursuing a trade qualification rather than graduating
                Secondary College. Secondly, moving 4 hours away from Melbourne, it became evident that my best option
                would be to withdraw from Deakin College and enroll with Open Universities.

                There are many Universities offering courses in IT. My decision to study with RMIT was based on the
                structure and the course content, offer by RMIT and whether I would connect with it.

                Furthermore, my goal is to earn a Bachelor of Computer Science. With limited pathways options and
                seemingly no online options, completing a Bachelor of Information Technology could create further
                development opportunities in the future.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                I am enrolled in this course to further develop my knowledge and understanding of Information
                Technology. I understand that Information Technology is not just about programming and although
                essential, it is only one element of the field.

                While studying IT I expect to gain a solid understanding of the following topics.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>&emsp; - What is Information Technology.</li>
                <li>&emsp; - Why do we use Information Technology.</li>
                <li>&emsp; - Where do we use Information Technology.</li>
                <li>&emsp; - How we apply Information Technology.</li>
              </ul>
         
              <p>
                By gaining a solid understanding of these ideas I have listed above,
                I expect to develop a solid understanding of the design, development and application of software and
                software systems.
